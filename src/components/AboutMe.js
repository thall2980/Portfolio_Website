      <h2>Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
      <p>Hello there! My name is Tyler Hall, and I am a Full Stack Web Developer based in Pittsburgh, PA. Before entering the tech world, I attended the University of Pittsburgh and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Biological Sciences.  I also worked as a Patient Care Technician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Presbyterian Hospital on a physical rehbailition unit. After realizing my true passion for programming and web development, I attended the Flatiron School Software Engineering program where I honed my skills in Ruby on Rails and React.js programming.  The fruits of my labor are this website and the technical projects on display! I am currently looking for my first position in the field in order to demonstrate my skills and grow as a web developer.

      Thank you for visiting my portfolio website, and please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or via email.
